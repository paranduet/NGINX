Problem: (13: Permission denied) while connecting to upstream:[nginx]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer: 
It turns out my issue was due to SELinux.

May be SELINUX is enabled or Enforcing, do the following command hopefully solve the problem
Option #1 : If yor are trusted
>> setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect 1

Check the following command to see log: 
>> cat /var/log/audit/audit.log | grep nginx | grep denied
And found that running the following commands fixed my issue:

>> cat /var/log/audit/audit.log | grep nginx | grep denied | audit2allow -M mynginx
>>  semodule -i mynginx.pp

Option #2 (untested, but probably more secure)
setsebool -P httpd_can_network_relay 1
